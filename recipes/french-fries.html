    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into thick fries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place sliced potatoes in a colander; sprinkle sugar over potatoes. Set aside until liquid is released from potatoes, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain liquid and dry potatoes well.</li>
        <li>Mix potato slices, olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a resealable plastic bag until evenly coated. Spread coated potato slices in a single layer, leaving space around each potato, on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
